# Jfokus 2017

*February 6 - 8, 2017*

Keynote: [Crossing the IoT Chasm](https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp#CrossingtheIoTChasm)

I gave my first IoT presentation over a decade ago. The response was overwhelming, and I've been waiting for the IoT tidal wave to land ever since. Strangely, it has not. Why not? Fast-forward through those ten years, and I have learned countless lessons. Join me as I review the strengths and weakness of hardware platforms designed to get you to market, examine how Big Data may just hold the key to IoT success, and glimpse at an AI-powered future.
